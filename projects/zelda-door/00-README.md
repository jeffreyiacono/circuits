## The Parts
### The Door
Made out of a wooden plank that was cut to size with a table and miter saw. Used
small hinges so the door can swing open and closed. Held together with a
combination of screws and nails. Used hand-held drill to make holes for the LEDs
to fit through.

### The Circuit
The breadboard mockup is the following ...

And here is the schematic view of the circuit ...

Apologies if this is not the standard/best way to present a schematic. I have no idea what I'm doing here ðŸ˜‰

### The Code
See [here](#file-01-door-monitor-py).

The script starts with some initial setup to get the board, pins, etc.
configured. When the switch changes, the `switchChangedFn` is
called and determines the state. If the switch is now open (ie. the door is
opened) the red LED is turned off, the green LED is turned on, and the wav file
is played by the pi. If the switch is closed (ie. the door is closed),
the green LED is turned off and the red LED is turned on.

## All Together
Here is what the pi, circuit, and back of the door look like:
